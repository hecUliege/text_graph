I can plan and deal with staff changing institution
there is an authoritative assertion of project funding
I can easily provide information when submitting data
I can report back to funders how useful it has been
to make it easier to assign the right metadata at the right time
publishing data and metadata does not come in the way of doing science
I can build my connections and collaborations
the task of filling in pro forma metadata does not appear to be so onerous that researchers simply don't do it
I don't have to spend further time filling in a form
I can apply multiple analyses and reviews
I can understand the coverage of the data
to include in conference papers, publications
it is indexed and found by the major search engines
in the future I can search for items in a way which I currently may not be able to predict e.g. all interviews related to Warhol etc
I am consistent
I don't have to point and click
metadata is collected at the right times throughout the project and not  just requested at the end
it becomes part of the normal data collection and analysis rather than an add-on at the end of the project
we have all the necessary data immediately available at the point of publication and deposit
it is there later on when we need it
there is a structured approach
at the right time it can be submitted by push button
metadata is picked up and submitted to minimise manual intervention at submission time
we don't get "scooped" by others immediately using our generated data before we have analysed it properly
all metadata is in non proprietary easily analysable format
I can create the most relevant information structure and necessary terms/abbreviations
I can accurately find relevant data
I can infer some metadata conclusions from the structure
I can find relevant/associated data and information
I don't have to  download the whole 100Tb archive!
the management overhead is kept to a minimum
to ensure instrument quality and image quality
submission of metadata at repository submission time can happen with automatically collected/generated metadata
I and others can replicate the circumstances of the image acquisition
to be efficient in tagging individual measurements / provenance metadata)
metadata does not need to be noted manually
I can replicate and build upon them
this (meta)data can be stored; currently it is shared by email but not transferred to a repository
we can include this in our corporate planning and provision
researchers understand what sort of metadata should be provided
all team members engage with best practice when creating metadata
this will encourage researchers to use it
metadata and data is produced in a consistent way by all partners
I can be sure that funder and institutional requirements have been complied with
I don't have to do it for them!
I can report to a management board and write a best practice guide for future researchers in the field
we avoid institutional memory loss and identify present and future custodians
I can make others aware of copyright and other issues when depositing (owner) and downloading data (user)
I can validate the dataset and mint a DOI
I can be confident of accessing good quality data and metadata
I know what to do
there is consistency and comparability between datasets within my field
it is kept together but easily accessed separately
the archiving process can be automated
things can be found
when the article or book is published the dataset is immediately accessible
we can check we've got it all for reporting
ftware and analysis which is currently submitted and stored on github is included and submission  does not need to be repeated
I can estimate the potential impact
to avoid confusion
I can collate data from departments to produce faculty reports to the central university and provide analysis and reports for the faculty deans
it can be used for any reporting/showcasing via web pages (via recording in Symplectic elements)
I can follow their journeys and subsequent use
I can use the most relevant specialist metadata and management but still share with other fields of study
researchers can use familiar workflows
to merge existing metadata into required metadata
I can create once and re-use many times
discipline and sub-discipline searches can be made easily
there is no need for changing or adapting it
my multiple different collaborative projects can all be stored in the same way and accessed by collaborators at different intuitions
issues of system interoperability, language, and sharing can be addressed
it can be understood across different disciplines  and wider project goals include all uses
we can make progress in new fields with emergent data e.g. precision medicine
to benefit Freedom of Information and other calls for data and to create more transparent links with digital sets of linked data
I can understand the origins of the a sample (biological: tissue, age/developmental stage (treatment, time points, reagents used etc.) and how it relates to other datasets (parallel experiments, controls)
both articles and associated data are easily discoverable
others can reuse and cite my data easily  (and I can do the same for other researchers)
I can show that experiment 1 leads to experiment 90 etc
the detailed information can be accessed and also stored outside of the preserved dataset so that it can be revised/updated
I don't have to keep up with correct/canonical names changing all the time, particularly for organisations and individuals' email addresses
we can deal with the future consequences of the current very fragmented picture of storage locations
I can record that relationship and repository users can take advantage of that information
I can be more confident the data will still be usable in the longer term
I can move institution but still have attribution for and access to "my" data - "data stays put, researcher moves"
users can tell when data is moving, for example, from controlled to Open Access
that I can sensibly reach an opinion on funding
for reporting, for archiving and to move to another system (e.g. when a researcher leaves)
Researchers can comply with other conditions/funders' requirements
we know which data is attached to which experiment/case
other users can understand the limitations of the model
for re-use
i can quickly find previous or later versions of the data
I can reproduce the processes and files originally used
i can search for experiments in a particular category
i can find relevant images in whatever format
I can find datasets associated with collaborating/competing labs and researchers
not just the PI is listed
I can record, store, share and archive digital objects or APIs which cannot be downloaded as a file either
I don't replicate unintentionally and can build on it
no one institution has a related identifier next to the data
I don't have to fill in biographical details
I am able to select the most relevant data
attribution in my data is correct and I can contact the right person for others' data
image sharing can be enhanced
to enable and allow access and use of data by other researchers
I know exactly what I am acquiring
for identification
I can share it to inform reporting to management
I can investigate the benefits of Linked Open Data
To facilitate re-use of the data and to justify RDM staff efforts
I can use the correct data for re-analysis
I can re-use the methodology on a different experiment
I can reproduce analyses
to help me understand both the research and its provenance
I can discover and understand what I am looking at
the research can be reproduced
I can reuse and share data easily
I can verify published results
I can understand and then reproduce experiments and results
researchers have the best chance of using the data in the future
I can be confident I am complying with the requirements of ethical approvals
I would rather have too much than too little
I can know its provenance and quality
I can use others' data and they can use mine
to enable accurate and productive searching
I can record the conditions of the experiment carried out
I can prove to the government that I am funding viable and important areas of research
I can reliably work with their data and vice versa
it can be accessed and used across different projects
to enable rapid easy generation of metadata using a controlled vocabulary with some limited use of free text
I don't have to enter it manually at archiving/repository submission /publication time
i can save time and effort communicating with funders
it saves time
I reap the benefit of the extra work I have put into creating rich metadata
I could have an opportunity to test alternative hypotheses with different datasets
I can identify trends and relationships
I can use it for book and journal publication as well as exhibitions
I can quickly retrieve appropriate data
I can be confident it is easily discoverable
I can refine the results as effectively as possible
colleagues and other researchers can use this data
to avoid duplication and maximise efficiency and access
For discovery, I don't have to rely on  the creator and the finder/user happening to agree on keywords/vocabulary
I can use familiar discipline specific terms
I can answer specific research questions from existing data
I can answer specific research questions through new analysis
we can search on free text of whole metadata
I can see what is already being done in my field of research
they can make practical use of my research so that my research is useful and put into use
the search (and research) outcomes are not restricted by the vocabulary
we can review and authorise this appropriately
we can determine what information is sensitive or not
I can do my job effectively, in particular I want to know how long datasets should be stored for, who should have access, licensing conditions etc
I know what I can and can't do with the data
users can see simply what they are allowed to do with the data
to encourage confident use and reuse
I don't need to worry about which bits should be made public and when (archival and storage should enable ongoing release timetable)
when accessing others' data in the repository I can assess whether I can use the data in my own experiments
i know whether to continue investigating its use
the correct "access" metadata will be visible to others who may want to use the data
I know what I can use and whether I can archive it
my participants are protected
it can be re-used for secondary analysis by other researchers
IP, confidentiality, publishing, storage and accessibility issues are all dealt with in a way which will be acceptable to industry partners
it can be easily done by author or even better automated by CrossRef/DataCite
we get more complete metadata
we can have richer metadata (but need to separate authoritative and non authoritative
metadata is attached at the right time and updated as the project continues
to allow addition of publication DOIs
metadata is available at all stages
I can (annually or automatically)  review descriptive narratives to pick out relevant/new/changing metadata terms
